            </figure>
            <p style="padding-bottom: 160px;">The Gomu Gomu no Mi is a violet, spherical shaped fruit with a stem sprouting out of the top, 
                with swirls that go in a curly "S" like-pattern. Its overall appearance greatly resembles a Yubari King.
                While its final design has the characteristic Devil Fruit swirls all over it, 
                the fruit was initially drawn without them in the first version of Romance Dawn.

            <hr style="border-top: 1px solid black; width: 98%;">
            <p style="padding-bottom: 30px;">Due to its unique nature, this Mythical Zoan Devil Fruit grants the user a baseline body with the properties of rubber. 
                However, due to the fruit's true power being dormant, the user's human body is limited to restrictions and transformations 
                similar in nature to most Paramecias. After achieving an Awakening though, the fruit's true power as a 
                Mythical Zoan is unleashed, giving the user a new transformation where their hair and clothes turn white, 
                their eyes glow red with white ring-like pupils, and white clouds float around their neck, giving them the 
                appearance of the mythical Sun God, Nika,[6] granting their already rubbery body more strength and freedom 
                and turning the user into a "Warrior of Liberation"
            </p>

            <hr style="border-top: 1px solid black; width: 98%;">
            <figure class="thumbr">
                <img src="https://pm1.narvii.com/6349/c9601774bce6f9a6de6ee2f1afdeee56cca5d2df_hq.jpg">

            </figure>
            <p style="padding-bottom: 30px; padding-bottom: 50px;">The fruit's major strength, as demonstrated by Luffy, 
                is that the user's body permanently adopts the properties of rubber: their body can 
                stretch, bend, bounce, inflate, and twist like said substance, even when the user himself 
                is nullified. <br><br>
                Unlike most other Devil Fruits, the effects of the Gomu Gomu no Mi are always active, 
                making the user's body permanently rubbery. The user becomes almost completely immune 
                to blunt damage, including hand-to-hand combat, blunt weapons, bullets, and even cannonballs, 
                all of which will just bounce off from his skin. Situations like falls from great heights and heavy 
                collisions that would kill a normal person end up being non-lethal or even painless, and certain traps 
                and hazards are rendered ineffective considering the user's enhanced flexibility
            </p>

                <figcaption class="thumbcap">Luffy's rubber body allows him to hit Enel, whose body is made of electricity.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p style="padding-bottom: 30px; padding-bottom: 50px;">The fruit enables all parts of the consumer's body to behave like rubber, 
                including their organs. This means that certain actions that otherwise would be impossible to do with a 
                normal human body, such as pumping one's own blood or bones with air, can be achieved through this ability 
                for extra speed or power. Furthermore, thanks to rubber's natural insulating properties, the user is also 
                immune to electrical attacks, such as those from the Goro Goro no Mi, Electro, and Zeus. This immunity to 
                electricity allows the user of the Gomu Gomu no Mi to hit the user of the Goro Goro no Mi (an electricity Logia) 
                without needing Haki.[14] Those same properties may also grant some resistance towards underwater pressure, 
                letting the user fight while surrounded by a deep underwater environment despite the usual Devil Fruit weakness.

                <figcaption class="thumbcap">Luffy using a stretching punch to hit a target from afar.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p style="padding-bottom: 30px; padding-bottom: 50px;">The user's ability to stretch and twist like 
                rubber to extreme lengths not only makes them immune to injuries that originate 
                from such, but it also grants them the skill to rebound from hard surfaces or reach 
                people that are far away from their position. For offense, stretching allows the user 
                to drastically increase the range of what would otherwise be considered a powerful close-range 
                attack, turning it into a devastating mid-range or long-range attack. A stretched limb can be used 
                to store potential energy like a stretched spring, increasing the velocity by stretching their arm back, 
                resulting in increased power.
