                <strong>Soru</strong><em>(剃 Soru?, literally meaning "Shave")</em>: With the enhanced metabolism, Luffy is able to perform the Rokushiki technique Soru, <br />
                allowing him to move at disappearing speeds. His prowess of it has surpassed that of Blueno's. <br />
                This was first seen being used against Blueno.<sup>[8]</sup> In the VIZ manga and Funimation dub, this is called <b>Shave</b>.

                <strong>Gomu Gomu no Jet Pistol</strong><em>(ゴムゴムのJETジェット銃ピストル Gomu Gomu no Jetto Pisutoru?, literally meaning "Rubber Rubber Jet Pistol/Gun")</em>: <img id="img45" src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/onepiece/images/2/26/Luffy_Uses_Jet_Pistol_on_Blackbeard.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/210?cb=20220628111358" />
                Luffy delivers a Gomu Gomu no Pistol so fast that the fist's movement is invisible, and it truly seems like he shoots his opponent,
                except that the resulting impact is not akin to an actual pistol, but to a small hand-held cannon and powerful enough to propel the unlucky recipient several meters
                away. The incredible speed both makes the strike far more powerful, and harder to dodge.
                When using this technique, he points his other hand via an open palm out to aim at his target,
                almost akin to shooting out a sudden burst of force from it.
                This was first seen being used against Blueno.<sup>[9]</sup> In the VIZ manga and Funimation adaptations, this is called <b>Gum-Gum Jet Pistol</b>. <br>

                <strong>Gomu Gomu no Jet Stamp</strong><em>(ゴムゴムのJETジェットスタンプ Gomu Gomu no Jetto Sutanpu?, literally meaning "Rubber Rubber Jet Stamp")</em>:
                Luffy delivers a Gomu Gomu no Stamp, with the same effect as the Jet Pistol.
                This was first seen being used against Blueno.<sup>[9]</sup>
                In the VIZ manga and Funimation dub, this is called <b>Gum-Gum Jet Stamp</b>.. <br>

                Luffy charges at his opponent at high speed and delivers an incredibly fast and strong <b>Gomu Gomu no Bazooka</b>, <br>
                having had his arms recoiled from the sudden impact and stopping short of his target in a quasi-horse-stance. <br>
                This was first seen being used against Blueno.<sup>[9]</sup>
                It was apparently powerful enough to break through Blueno's strongest Tekkai technique, <br>
                <b>Tekkai: Go</b>, as well as Boa Marigold's Busoshoku Haki-enforced guard. During the battle against Moria in his Shadow's Asgard form,<br>
                Luffy demonstrated being able to use this move to propel himself from mid-air, allowing him to perform this attack continuously.<sup>[10]</sup> <br>
