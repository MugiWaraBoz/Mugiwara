            </figure>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">This technique involves Luffy speeding up the blood flow in all or selected body parts, 
                in order to provide them with more oxygen and nutrients. This makes him much faster 
                and more powerful. The technique uses even more oxygen and energy, using up more food 
                and causing Luffy to pant heavily.[1] The increase in his metabolism causes him to be 
                hungrier than usual or even have a paralysis type effect after prolonged use of it, 
                like in the second fight with Rob Lucci, where Luffy was only able to lie on the floor. 
                Lucci, one of the first of Luffy's opponents to witness it, compares the process to doping.
                 Doping is adding more red blood cells to the body part/s, which in turn allows for greater 
                 delivery of oxygen and nutrients to the body part/s. In Luffy's case, his organs and blood 
                 vessels are made of rubber allowing them to expand and contract at greater rates without tearing.
                 Essentially, Luffy increases the blood flow by forcing more blood through his blood vessels thus 
                 increase his fighting ability. This mode's enhancements to Luffy's physiology giving him the 
                 ability to use a new, stronger set of techniques which are generally the same as his old ones 
                 but are so fast that even a skilled assassin would have a hard time actually seeing them.
                  He developed this ability after encountering CP9 and watching them use Soru.
                  This is called Gear Two in the VIZ manga, Second Gear in the official simulcast 
                  subs and in the Funimation dub. After seeing Luffy use Gear 2 and understanding how 
                  it works, Rob Lucci speculated that using this technique would likely reduce his lifespan.</p>

            <p style="padding-bottom: 30px;">Gomu Gomu no Jet Pistol (ゴムゴムのJETジェット銃ピストル Gomu Gomu no Jetto Pisutoru?, 
                literally meaning "Rubber Rubber Jet Pistol/Gun"): Luffy delivers a Gomu Gomu no Pistol so fast that the fist's
                 movement is invisible, and it truly seems like he shoots his opponent, except that the resulting impact is not 
                 akin to an actual pistol, but to a small hand-held cannon and powerful enough to propel the unlucky recipient 
                 several meters away. The incredible speed both makes the strike far more powerful, and harder to dodge. When using 
                 this technique, he points his other hand via an open palm out to aim at his target, almost akin to shooting out a 
                 sudden burst of force from it. This was first seen being used against Blueno.
                In the VIZ manga and Funimation adaptations, this is called Gum-Gum Jet Pistol.

            <p style="padding-bottom: 30px;">(ゴムゴムのJETジェットバズーカ Gomu Gomu no Jetto Bazūka?, 
                literally meaning "Rubber Rubber Jet Bazooka"): Luffy charges at his opponent at high speed 
                and delivers an incredibly fast and strong Gomu Gomu no Bazooka, having had his arms recoiled 
                from the sudden impact and stopping short of his target in a quasi-horse-stance. This was first 
                seen being used against Blueno.[9] It was apparently powerful enough to break through Blueno's 
                strongest Tekkai technique, Tekkai: Go, as well as Boa Marigold's Busoshoku Haki-enforced guard. 
                During the battle against Moria in his Shadow's Asgard form, Luffy demonstrated being able to use 
                this move to propel himself from mid-air, allowing him to perform this attack continuously.
                 In the VIZ manga and Funimation adaptations, this is called Gum-Gum Jet Bazooka.

            <p style="padding-bottom: 30px; padding-bottom: 50px;">(ゴムゴムのJETジェット銃乱打ガトリング Gomu Gomu no Jetto Gatoringu?, 
                literally meaning "Rubber Rubber Jet Gun Battering"): This is Luffy's strongest technique in Gear 2 at the time. Luffy 
                stands still, bends forward and moves his arms upwards at speeds which they can no longer be seen, leaving only jet 
                streams in their place, very much like how the Jet Pistol looks. This results in an effect comparable to Foxy's Kyubi 
                Rush, except that Luffy does not need to make use of Noro Noro photons to slow down his target in order to accumulate 
                the hits. The hits land so fast that, after a volley, they seemingly connect simultaneously. The circles of air bursts 
                from the punches surrounding Luffy, resemble the many barrels of an actual gatling gun. However, due to the large amount 
                of energy it uses, Luffy cannot sustain it for long, although the time it is used is longer than the regular Gatling. 
                This was first used to defeat Rob Lucci.[13] During his fight against the combined efforts of Marigold and Sandersonia, 
                Luffy demonstrated an omni-directional version of this move by falling on his back, then, while lying down, launches a 
                rapid barrage of powerful high-speed punches from the ground, effectively nullifying both sister's attacks.
                 In the VIZ manga and Funimation adaptations, this is called Gum-Gum Jet Gatling.
